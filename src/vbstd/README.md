# VuiBui Standard Library

The VuiBui standard library is an attempt at creating a collection of short,
common functions that are universally useful to Game Boy programs.

## About

The contents of this library should be universally relevant and useful to have
on hand, without causing too much ROM bloat or forcing a certain pattern or
genre. This includes things like MemCopy, Rand, and the ubiquitous hardware.inc,
but not things such as a print function or metasprite code which would increase
ROM size and only be useful to some programs.

Please note that some files in this library come from other sources with
existing licenses, such as hardware.inc and input.asm.
