Currently being built on the master branch of RGBDS, version 0.5.1

Requires a POSIX environment with GNU make and Python to build.

[Rangi's Tilemap Studio](https://github.com/Rangi42/tilemap-studio) is used to create binary map files for the menus.

[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) is used to create the game's world map. Tilesets and Maps are stored as `.json` files to allow the use of other programs. The makefile will automatically use `tools/tiledbin.py` to convert Tiled's JSON files into binary maps.

Naming Conventions:

- All labels are `PascalCase`
  - Prefix `v`: Video RAM
